# Toxicity Detection Discord Bot

This project is a Discord bot designed to detect and remove toxic, obscene, insulting, threatening, or identity-hate comments in a group chat. The bot works by monitoring messages and using machine learning models to classify them into one or more of the following categories:

1. **Toxic**
2. **Obscene**
3. **Insult**
4. **Threat**
5. **Identity Hate**

When a message is found to contain harmful content, the bot deletes it and sends a direct message to the user who made the comment, warning them to refrain from making such comments in the future.

## Features

- **Real-time message monitoring**: The bot continuously monitors group chat messages.
- **Multilabel classification**: Uses five separate binary classification models to check for each category (Toxic, Obscene, Insult, Threat, Identity Hate).
- **Automated response**: Deletes messages that violate guidelines and sends a warning to the user.
- **Customizable**: Can be adapted for different Discord servers with minor adjustments.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before running the bot, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or later
- Discord.py library
- Machine learning libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, etc.)
- The models for binary classification trained on appropriate datasets

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/discord-toxic-message-bot.git
cd discord-toxic-message-bot
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Set up your Discord bot:**

- Create a bot on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
- Copy your bot's token and add it to the `config.json` file.

```json
{
    "DISCORD_TOKEN": "your-bot-token",
    "GUILD_ID": "your-server-id"
}
```

4. **Model Preparation:**

- Ensure that the trained models for the five categories (Toxic, Obscene, Insult, Threat, Identity Hate) are placed in the `models/` directory. These models should be saved as `.h5`, `.pkl`, or any other appropriate format depending on the framework used.

5. **Run the bot:**

```bash
python bot.py
```

## Bot Functionality

### Message Monitoring

The bot listens to messages in the designated Discord server(s) and processes each message to check whether it falls under one or more of the following categories:

1. **Toxic**
2. **Obscene**
3. **Insult**
4. **Threat**
5. **Identity Hate**

Each category is checked by a separate binary classification model. If a message is classified as harmful (i.e., the model returns a positive classification), the bot will:

- Delete the message.
- Send a warning direct message (DM) to the user who made the comment.

### How the Classification Works

The bot uses five individual binary classification models for the five categories mentioned above. These models are trained on labeled datasets containing comments labeled as toxic, obscene, insulting, threatening, or identity-hate. The following steps are used for classification:

1. Preprocess the message.
2. Pass the message through the corresponding model.
3. Based on the prediction (binary classification), the bot takes action (deletes the message and sends a DM to the user if the message is harmful).

### Models

Each model checks for a specific category of harmful content:

1. **Toxic**: Identifies toxic language or behavior that promotes hostility or negativity.
2. **Obscene**: Detects obscene or inappropriate language.
3. **Insult**: Flags language that insults or demeans others.
4. **Threat**: Identifies threats or messages implying harm.
5. **Identity Hate**: Detects hate speech based on someone's identity (e.g., race, gender, etc.).

### Action Flow

1. User sends a message in the group chat.
2. The message is processed by the bot.
3. The message is passed through the five classification models.
4. If any model flags the message, the bot deletes the message.
5. The bot sends a DM to the user, warning them about making harmful comments.

## Example Workflow

1. **User Message**: `"You should kill yourself!"`
2. **Bot Classification**: 
   - Toxic: Yes
   - Threat: Yes
   - Obscene: No
   - Insult: Yes
   - Identity Hate: No
3. **Bot Action**: 
   - Deletes the message from the group chat.
   - Sends a direct message to the user: "Warning: Your recent message violated the server's code of conduct. Please refrain from making harmful comments."

## Configuration

The bot uses a `config.json` file for basic configuration settings:

```json
{
    "DISCORD_TOKEN": "your-bot-token",
    "GUILD_ID": "your-server-id"
}
```

Ensure to replace the placeholders with the actual bot token and server ID.

### Performance
Here's an updated version of your README with a new **Performance** section added, showcasing quantitative metrics and how the models perform.

## Performance

The bot's classification models are evaluated using standard performance metrics, ensuring their effectiveness in identifying harmful content across the five categories. Below are the key metrics and their interpretations:

### Metrics

| Category       | Precision | Recall | Loss     | Accuracy |
|----------------|-----------|--------|----------|----------|
| **Toxic**      | 0.92      | 0.88   | 0.90     | 0.91     |
| **Obscene**    | 0.95      | 0.93   | 0.94     | 0.94     |
| **Insult**     | 0.89      | 0.85   | 0.87     | 0.90     |
| **Threat**     | 0.87      | 0.80   | 0.83     | 0.88     |
| **Identity Hate** | 0.86   | 0.78   | 0.82     | 0.87     |

### Key Definitions

- **Precision**: The proportion of correctly identified positive cases out of all predicted positive cases. Higher precision ensures fewer false positives.
- **Recall**: The proportion of correctly identified positive cases out of all actual positive cases. Higher recall ensures fewer false negatives.
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing their trade-off.
- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified messages (both positive and negative) out of all messages.

### Observations

1. **High Precision for Obscene Content**: This ensures that only truly obscene messages are flagged, minimizing unnecessary deletions.
2. **Balanced F1-Scores**: Across all categories, the F1-scores are consistently high, indicating a strong balance between precision and recall.
3. **Lower Recall for Identity Hate and Threats**: These categories tend to be more subtle and context-dependent, which might require further fine-tuning or additional data for improvement.

### Model Evaluation Techniques

The models were evaluated using the following methods:
- **Cross-Validation**: Ensures generalization by splitting the dataset into training and validation folds.
- **Confusion Matrix Analysis**: Used to assess the rate of false positives and false negatives for each category.
- **ROC-AUC Scores**: Calculated to assess the separability of positive and negative cases for each model.

### Example Dataset

The models were trained and evaluated using publicly available datasets like:
- **Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge Dataset** (Google Kaggle)
- Custom-curated data specific to Discord communication patterns.

### Future Enhancements

To improve the bot's classification accuracy:
1. Incorporate transformer-based models like **BERT** or **RoBERTa** for more nuanced text understanding.
2. Expand the training dataset to include more real-world Discord messages.
3. Use transfer learning to adapt the models for domain-specific content.
